    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[I would try explaining to the customer what the different threats that can occur are and how they can happen (Cross Site Scripting, SQL Injection, Cross site request forgery). After explaining and hopefully the customer understanding, I would tell the customer about the best practises to ensure the security of your website. The practises I would tell them about are: Sanitization of data, Making use of secure authorization and authentication such as OneLogin or other frameworks, making use of a known and trusted third-party application (I would of course tell the customer to research the legitimacy of the application), continuous deployment/continuous integration, network security for example firewalls and implementation of automatic user timeout.]</p>
